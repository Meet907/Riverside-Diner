File and Folder Meanings:
    "files" folder is where we put the scripts for this project. This folder should only have ".py" files in it.
    "static" folder is where all of our javascipt and CSS/SASS is goiong to go.
    "templates" folder is where all of our HTML pages are going to go

    "app.py" is the main file, it should be the only .py file outside of the "files" folder. This is the file that will allow us to deploy our SaaS to the web
    "changes.txt" is where I would like us to put down any changes we make to the project. ANY changes. 
        ex. "Removed x code block", "edited y file and how", "changed or added z and where". Any changes we make. 
        This will help us to do our Weekly Status Reports as well as keep everyone on the same page on the status of the project.
        I would like every entry to be dated and added initials so we know when and who made the change
            Ex. "1/25 - Added another route to the app.py file - AS"
    "list.todo" is self explanitory, its a running todo list for our project. We can add, remove, and complete features as we please to this list 
        best used with "TODO+" Extension

    Ignore ".vscode" folder
